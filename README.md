# Hallon - HAL Framework for .NET Web API 2

Design goals

- Do not pollute domain models
- Convention over configuration (should just work)
- Choice between fluent API and attributes

```
GET /orders/523 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept: application/hal+json

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/hal+json

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/orders/523" },
       "warehouse": { "href": "/warehouse/56" },
       "invoice": { "href": "/invoices/873" }
     },
     "currency": "USD",
     "status": "shipped",
     "total": 10.20
   }
```
